# TIY-Ember+Ember-CLI-Todomvc

This is a quick conversion of the standard [Ember TodoMVC app](http://emberjs.com/guides/getting-started/) to work with the newer [Ember CLI](http://www.ember-cli.com). No magic here that's not Ember magic. Move along please. :) 

## Installation

* `git clone <repository-url>` this repository
* change into the new directory
* `npm install`
* `bower install`
* open localhost:4200 to view the running app

## Thanks
